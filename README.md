Resource loading mechanism

## Background

There are many contexts in which the use of relative URLs to locate resources is important.
In a web page, any `href` attribute is resolved relative to the URL of the page itself (_i.e._ if the document&rsquo;s
URL is `http://kjson.io/testing/abc1.html`, then `href="abc2.html"` resolves to `http://kjson.io/testing/abc2.html`).
In JSON Schema, a `$ref` property is resolved relative to the containing schema.
The use of relative references means that bundles of resources can be packaged together and retain their ability to
cross-reference each other.

The JVM standard libraries provide functionality for accessing resources by means of URLs, but they do not meet all the
requirements of a system based on relative URLs.
This library provides a means of locating resources in files, via `http` or `https` addresses, from the classpath or
from any JAR file.

**BREAKING CHANGE:** Version 4.0 of this library makes major changes to the way this library is used; any code written
for earlier versions will require significant changes.
All of the previous functionality should be available, but the means of accessing it may be very different.

## Quick Start

For anyone wishing to implement a resource loader using this library, a good example is the `XMLLoader` class in the
tests in the project source.

```kotlin
class XMLLoader(
    baseURL: URL = defaultBaseURL(),
) : ResourceLoader<Document>(baseURL) {

    override val defaultExtension: String = "xml"

    override val defaultMIMEType: String = "text/xml"

    override fun load(rd: ResourceDescriptor): Document = rd.inputStream.use { inputStream ->
        val inputSource = InputSource(inputStream)
        inputSource.systemId = rd.url.toString()
        rd.charsetName?.let { inputSource.encoding = it }
        getDocumentBuilder().parse(inputSource)
    }

    private val documentBuilderFactory: DocumentBuilderFactory by lazy {
        DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance()
    }

    private fun getDocumentBuilder(): DocumentBuilder = documentBuilderFactory.newDocumentBuilder()

}
```

`XMLLoader` extends the abstract base class `ResourceLoader`, specifying the result type to be the XML `Document` class,
  and providing two overriding values and one function (only the function is required; the values are optional):
- `defaultExtension`: the default extension to be used (in this case &ldquo;`xml`&rdquo;)
- `defaultMIMEType`: the default MIME type
- `load`: a function to load a resource using the information provided in a `ResourceDescriptor` (which includes an
  `InputStream`, the URL and other details about the resource if available)

`XMLLoader` also takes an optional constructor parameter `baseURL`; this may be used to specify the base against which
relative URL strings are resolved (the default is the current working directory).

## More Detail

The `ResourceLoader` is capable of handling resources from three source types, each with its own type of URL, and each
with its own set of complications:
1. A classic network resource, with a URL starting with `http:` or `https:`
2. A file in the local file system, identified by a `File` or a `Path`, or located using a `file:` URL
3. A file in a JAR, identified by a `jar:` URL

The `resource` function of `ResourceLoader` will accept a <span title="java.net.URL">`URL`</span>, a
<span title="java.io.File">`File`</span> or a <span title="java.nio.file.Path">`Path`</span>, and return a `Resource`.
The `Resource` may then be used to load the resource, or as a basis for resolving a relative address.

(At this point it's worth noting that the `Class.getResource()` function from the standard JVM library returns a `URL?`
so the `XMLLoader` can be used to access resources on the classpath just as easily as those in the local file system, or
on an HTTP(S) server; the `Resource.classPathURL(name)` function is a convenience wrapper around the JVM function.)

If the resource is a file (as opposed to a directory) the `resource.load()` function will retrieve the content &ndash;
in the case of a `Resource` obtained from the `XMLLoader`, parsing it as XML.

The `resource.resolve(String)` function will resolve the string relative to the `Resource`, and return a new `Resource`;
this can then be used to load the actual resource, and also may be used to locate other resources relative to itself.

If the ability to follow relative links from one resource to another is not needed, a simpler form of access is to use:
```kotlin
    val resource = resourceLoader.load(relativeURL)
```
The relative URL string is resolved against the `baseURL` for the `ResourceLoader`, and the resulting URL is used to
read the resource.

More documentation to follow...

## Filters

Regardless of the way in which a `Resource` is obtained, access to the underlying resource will be by means of the URL,
and filters may be used to modify, replace or block the connection.

To add a filter:
```kotlin
    resourceLoader.addConnectionFilter { if (it !is HttpURLConnection || it.url.host in acceptableHosts) it else null }
```

The signature of the filter is `(URLConnection) -> URLConnection?`, and there are, in effect, four options for the
return value:
1. The input value may be returned unmodified.
2. The input `URLConnection` may be modified (for example, by adding headers to an `HttpURLConnection`) and returned.
3. A new `URLConnection` may be returned in place of the original (for example, substituting a file-based
   `URLConnection` for an `HttpURLConnection`).
4. A return value of `null` will cause the connection to be vetoed; this may be used to ensure that external references
   in included files may be blocked from accessing resources from untrusted sites (see the example above).

### Authorization Filter

The `AuthorizationFilter` allows a single request header to be added to the connection.
If multiple headers are required, multiple filters may be used.

A convenience function will add an `AuthorizationFilter`:
```kotlin
    resourceLoader.addAuthorizationFilter(
        host = "example.com",
        headerName = "Authorization",
        headerValue = accessToken,
    )
```
This will cause an "`Authorization`" header to be added to all requests to a host with the name
&ldquo;`example.com`&rdquo;.

If wildcard matching of host names (or other complex matching, like a member of a set) is required, a `StringMatcher`
(see [`string-matcher`](https://github.com/pwall567/string-matcher)) may be supplied in place of the literal host name.

### Redirection Filter

The `RedirectionFilter` allows requests to a nominated host to be redirected to a substitute location.
When used in conjunction with an `AuthorizationFilter`, the `RedirectionFilter` must be added first.

Again, a convenience function will add the filter:
```kotlin
    resourceLoader.addRedirectionFilter(
        fromHost = "example.com",
        fromPort = -1, // -1 means unspecified
        toHost = "localhost",
        toPort = 8080,
    )
```
This will cause all requests to &ldquo;`example.com`&rdquo; to be redirected to &ldquo;`localhost:8080`&rdquo;.
As with `addAuthorizationFilter()` if more complex host name matching is required, a `StringMatcher` may be supplied in
place of the literal host name.

### Prefix-Based Redirection Filter

The `PrefixRedirectionFilter` allows requests to be redirected based on the prefix substring of the URL.
This may be used, for example, to redirect external HTTP(S) calls to the local filesystem.

Again, a convenience function will add the filter:
```kotlin
    resourceLoader.addPrefixRedirectionFilter(
        fromPrefix = "https://example.com/api/schema/",
        toPrefix = localDirectory.absoluteFile.toURI().toString(),
    )
```
This will cause all requests to addresses starting with `https://example.com/api/schema/` to be redirected to a location
in the local filesystem described by `localDirectory` (a `java.io.File`).
